# HTMLDocuments
Collection of HTML files created by me 
<h2>How its Made</h2>
<p>These files were created using HTML</p>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>Removed all "div" components and replaced them with a more semantic tag that more relates to what I want on the page</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
  While building these pages I realized that a simple HTML page can function as a fully responsive, working website as long as the content is still there.
  I also learned that accessibility is key to creating web pages, because you want your content to reach a wide audience of people. This means individuals with disabilities
  as well as those who do not have highspeed broadband internet to render the CSS and JS within the site created.
